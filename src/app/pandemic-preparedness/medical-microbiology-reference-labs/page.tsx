					In Norway, several key institutions serve as reference laboratories in
					the field of medical microbiology, providing essential support for
					diagnosing, monitoring, and researching infectious diseases. These
					reference labs play a crucial role in ensuring high-quality testing
					and supporting public health efforts.
				</p>
				<p>
					As of 2024 Norway has no national system for bio-banking samples
					related to pathogens. Each laboratory has its policy to store (if any
					and duration) the samples.
