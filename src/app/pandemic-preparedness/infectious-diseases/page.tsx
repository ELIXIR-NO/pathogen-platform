				<p>
					Infectious diseases are disorders caused by organisms such as
					bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. Many of these organisms are
					normally harmless and can even reside on or within an organism (e.g.,
					the human body or an animal) at any given time. However, under certain
					conditions, some organisms can cause disease. These diseases can
					spread directly or indirectly from one individual to another, from
					animal to human, through insect or animal bites, or by consuming
					contaminated food or water.
				</p>
				<p>
					These diseases can affect plants, animals, and humans, manifesting in
					various symptoms that can be mild, severe, or even deadly, impacting
					health and productivity. In plants, infectious diseases can cause
					symptoms such as wilting, blights, and rusts, significantly impacting
					agricultural productivity and food security. In animals, these
					diseases not only affect the health of domestic and agricultural
					industries but also wildlife conservation. Moreover, some infectious
					diseases are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to
					humans. In humans, infectious diseases are a major public health
					concern, capable of causing widespread outbreaks and pandemics with
					high morbidity and mortality rates.

				<h3 className="font-bold">Threats to Everyday Life</h3>
				<p>
					Infectious diseases pose significant threats to everyday life and
					medical treatment. They can disrupt daily activities, cause widespread
					health crises, and place immense pressure on healthcare systems. In
					the medical field, infectious diseases are particularly concerning
					because they can lead to hospital-acquired infections, complicate
					surgeries and other treatments, and contribute to antibiotic
					resistance. This resistance makes it increasingly challenging to treat
					common infections, turning them into severe health threats.
